## where does "e-shrdlu" come from?

Where does "e-shrdlu" come from? Well originally I wanted "e. shrdlu", but sadly github does not allow dots or spaces in usernames. So I settled for "e-shrdlu"

Let me tell you a story.

It's the 19th century. You want to print a newspaper. Fist, you need to find someone with a printing press and convince them to let you use it. Once you've done that and you're ready to start printing, you need to gather each individual letter, one by one, and line them up. Once youve finished that, you can load this into the printing press, and start printing. As one can imagine, this process -- gathering each letter of a page one-by-one -- can take quite some time. However, there is a better way.

Invented in 1884, the linotype machine allows the operator to set an entire line of type (hence the name: "line o' type") at once. It was, essentially, a typewriter, but instead of producing a line of ink on paper, it produced a metal block with raised letters.

Now what happens when you make a mistake? Well, you could manually go in and switch out the letters before the whole line is printed, but who has time for that? Just fill out the rest of the line, wait for the machine to spit out the block, throw it out, and start the line over! And if you've ever had to type out filler text, you know exactly what you do. You run your finger along the keyboard and type something like "asdfghjkl;", "qwertyuiop", or "zxcvbnm". A glance at the linotype machine's keyboard reveals what an operator may have typed in such an instance:

Thats right, "etaoinshrdlu" is the original "asdf"!

Sometimes these blocks were not thrown away, and instead made it to the final print, resulting in the sequence appearing in newspapers. This happened enough that a documentary about the transition from the linotype machine to more modern techniques was titled "Farewell, Etaoin Shrdlu".

To those interested in cryptography, that sequence may look familiar. In fact, the keyboard was arranged according to letter frequency. "e", being the most commonly used letter, was first, followed by "t", "a", and so on. Letter frequency is commonly used to crack a simple substitution cipher. For example, if a given ciphertext has the letter "q" appearing most, its quite likely that it represents an "e" (or a "t", "a", "o", etc).

I should mention that, strictly speaking, "etaoin" is not, in fact, the original "asdf", as the typewriter was invented first. But "etaoin" and "shrdlu" were, as far as I can tell, more popular earlier on than "asdf".

etaoin had a good run there, and asdf still hasnt even surpassed it at its peak!

Of course, it doesn't really matter if it was the original or not, the real reason for choosing this name is the simple fact that there was no way I could have gotten "asdf" as a username anywhere without appending a huge number to the end.
